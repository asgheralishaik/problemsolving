# Leetcode Solutions

Idea behind this repository is to pick a random question on Leetcode and try to solve it and send it as a Pull Request to this repository. The main idea is to learn and teach and learn and teach, this way everyone in this forum gets better.

A Pull Request should contain

- Explanation: the Explanation of Logic
- Time Complexity: O(n), O(n <sup> 2 </sup>), O(n log n), O(log n), O(n x m) etc
- Space Complexity: O(n), O(n <sup> 2 </sup>), O(n log n), O(log n), O(n x m) etc
- Notify: Tag the teammates so that they are notified about the PR
- More Information: Any other information, you learnt during implementing the logic, you think would be useful for this forum 

Your Solution Java file should follow naming convention
Problem Number on Leetcode and Title
For Ex: 20th Problem on Leetcode has Title ValidParentheses, it would follow `P0020_ValidParentheses` under the package `com.leetcode.crackthecodes.solutions`

Create a base Test cases under the test sources of the repository, following TDD approach and then implement the method to be tested. We follow a similar pattern for Test cases. Under `com.leetcode.crackthecodes.solutions` and test name `P0020_ValidParenthesesTest`.

Happy Coding!
